# Stopwatch

## Project #5 of My Vanilla JavaScript Journey 🚀

Hey there! Welcome to my Stopwatch project. This is the fifth project in my journey of creating 30+ JavaScript projects to improve my coding skills. I'm building these projects to learn and experiment with vanilla JavaScript, and this one focuses on time manipulation and DOM updates.

### What I Built 🛠️

A clean and simple stopwatch that features:
- Hours, minutes, and seconds display
- Start, stop, and reset functionality
- Sleek UI with a gradient background
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Custom monospace font (Courier Prime) for that classic digital look

### Tech Stack 💻

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks!)

### What I Learned 📚

- Working with JavaScript's timing functions (setInterval)
- DOM manipulation for real-time updates
- Ternary operators for number formatting
- CSS gradients and box shadows for modern UI
- Responsive design principles

### Try It Out! 🎮

Just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser - no setup required!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheC0deJunkie/stopwatch.git
```

### Part of My Coding Journey 🗺️
